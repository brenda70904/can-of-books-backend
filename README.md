## Professional Pairing Practice/ Our Agreement

### Logistical

• Hours of communication: Open
• Communication platforms: Slack, phone
• Breaks: once an hour
• Fall behind plan: Don’t worry, ask a TA for help and see if we can fit in an extra hour or stay later one day.

### Cooperative

• Aubrey strengths: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, time management, research skills
• Brenda strengths: Asking questions, research, JavaScript, React, Node.js
• How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application:
  >We can make something functional with Brendas skill in JS and visually appealing/ easy to use with Aubrey’s CSS skills.
• Aubrey improve: JavaScript
• Brenda improve: CSS
• Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development:
  >Maintain open communication, constantly share screens (driver/navigator) on where we get stuck. Hold an “update meeting” on our progress anywhere from 2-3x a day.

### Conflict Resolution

• What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing:
  >We are adults, talk it out. Raise concern, make sure we understand our given tasks.
• What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute:
  >Same answer to previous question.

• How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level:
  >Ask for help, do mental health checks to make sure we understand the task fully.
